## âœ¨ Features

- **File Handling**: Supports both reading and creating files. Perfect for file manipulation operations through HTTP requests.

- **User Agent Routing**: Special handling for requests with the `User-Agent` header.

- **Echo Route**: You can echo back whatever is appended to the `/echo/` endpoint, making it useful for quick tests.

- **Educational**: Designed primarily as a learning exercise to understand the workings of a basic HTTP server in Rust.

- **Extensible**: Despite its simplicity, the server can be further developed and integrated into larger projects.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

- **`GET /`**: Returns HTTP 200 for index routes.

- **`GET /user-agent`**: Returns HTTP 200 and echoes back the `User-Agent` if present in the request headers.

- **`GET /echo/{message}`**: Returns HTTP 200 and echoes back the `{message}`. For example, a GET request to `/echo/hello` would return "hello".

- **`GET /files/{name_of_file}`**: If the file exists in the directory (provided as a command line argument), it returns the file with HTTP 200. Otherwise, returns HTTP 404.

- **`POST /files/{name_of_file}`**: Creates a new file in the directory (provided as a command line argument) with the content from the request body. Returns HTTP 201 with a success message.

## ðŸ’¡ What to Learn

This is an excellent project to understand:

- Basic HTTP protocol operations
- Socket programming in Rust
- Multi-threading
- File I/O
- Simple routing logic
